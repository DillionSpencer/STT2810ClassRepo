Directions: Select three _secondary_ categorical variables from the data set you are using.  Recode your data to create factors with appropriate labels.  Create a barplot for each of your factors and write a sentence or two explaining each barplot.  Show all `R` code used to manage your data and used to create your barplots with `R` code chunks in your `*.Rmd` file.  Submit the resulting `*.html` file to crowdgrader.
