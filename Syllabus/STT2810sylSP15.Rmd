There will be roughly 15 graded assignments (one per week). 15% of the course grade will be for a research proposal. Eleven of the graded assignments will be peer evaluated via http://www.crowdgrader.org.  Your grade for a peer evaluated assignment will be a combination of peer evaluations and an evaluation of your peer grading.  Specific rubrics and directions for each assignment will be provided on the course repository.  Peer evaluations will account for 50% of the course grade.  15% of the course grade will be for a poster each student will create and present during the final exam period of the course.  The remaining 20% of the course will be for participation.
