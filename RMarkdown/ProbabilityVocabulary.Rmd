* Each time we observe a random phenomenon is called a **trial** or **experiment**.  The value of the trial is the **outcome**.  If we combine outcomes, we have an **event**.  The set of all events possible is the **sample space**, $S$ or $\Omega$.

* The **probability** of an event is its long term relative frequency.  $P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in A}}{\text{Number of possible outcomes in } S}$

**Example:** Arrive at the 105 intersection with Wendy's.

* Look at the signal = ?
* See a red light = ?
* What can you see? 
* Define the event E "keep going".  E = ?

**Probability Axioms**

1. For any event $A$, $0 \le P(A) \le 1$.
2. $P(S) = 1$ where $S$ is the sample space.
3. $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$ so $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$.
4. $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$.  If $P(A\cap B) =0$, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.
5. $P(A \cap B)= P(A) \times P(B)$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ are independent.

If $P(A \cap B)=0$, events are disjoint.

**Example:** Roll a fair die.  Define the event $E$ to be outcomes less than 4.  Define the event $F$ to be outcomes that are even.  Are the events $E$ and $F$ independent?

**Example:** Draw a card from a deck of cards.  Define the event $E$ to be getting a heart.  Define the event $F$ to be getting a King.  Are the events $E$ and $F$ independent?
